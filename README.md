# Study Log

## *This is a journal of my Front End learning path*

I'm going to document my progress in the field of web development by putting up a journal containing all my learnings, exercises, courses, as well as everything else than helped me on my path of becoming a better Front End Developer. 

I'm going to keep this going for a few months in order to have a clear view of the progress that I'm going to make.

Lastly, I'm doing this in the shape of a GitHub repository in order to get used to using Git in the terminal and Markdown syntax.

## **WEEK 1 (8-12 January)**:

### **Monday**: 
* Got an intro to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and looked through the seo pages' code.
* Worked on the UL componenet which resulted in a better understanding of Flexbox (esp. flex-basis).

### **Tuesday**: 
* Continued with a Flexbox course - [Flexbox Zombies](https://geddski.teachable.com/courses/) by geddski - Understood more about flex-grow and flex-shrink.
* Got an intro on Gulp (mainly about how tasks work and Gulp in general) thanks to Max. ^^
* Created a new element in the ShowcarUI library with Max - the [link-text-box molecule](https://autoscout24.github.io/showcar-ui/#link-text-box-target) 

### **Wednesday**: 
* Continued with a Flexbox course - [Flexbox Zombies](https://geddski.teachable.com/courses/) by geddski - Understood more about flex-basis and order.
* Worked on ShowcarUI (got my own task) and renamed the new elements.
* Learned more about Git and terminal (PRs, branches, remotes...).

### **Thursday**: 
* 'Worked' on the SEO images optimization task with Max and looked a bit at Gulp again.
* Continued with a Flexbox course - [Flexbox Zombies](https://geddski.teachable.com/courses/) by geddski - Understood more about flex-wrap.
* More Git - solved some conflicts my fork had with the upstream master branch (Diana helped clarify a few things ^^).
* Used Hugo in practice for the first time (with Yifan) while working on the adjusting the SEO hub pages task. It was a bit confusing, but not as hard as I previously thought => I definitely need more Hugo practice/learning. 

### **Friday**: 
* Worked on a task given to me by Mimmo - Had to fix some bugs/do some changes to a few of ShowcarUI's new elements.
* Got a better understanding of Git.
* Watched some vidoes on how the Internet works.

## **TODO next**: 
* Look at Hugo's [docs](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) for detailed info.
* Look at Gulp [docs](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/API.md) for detailed info.
* Do a course on Git (from Udemy) - [Git Fundamentals](https://www.udemy.com/git-novice-to-expert/learn/v4/overview)
