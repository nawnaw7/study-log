# Study Log

## *This is a journal of my Front End learning path*

I'm going to document my progress in the field of web development by putting up a journal containing all my learnings, exercises, courses, as well as everything else than helped me on my path of becoming a better Front End Developer. 

I'm going to keep this going for a few months in order to have a clear view of the progress that I'm making.

Lastly, I'm doing this in the shape of a GitHub repository in order to get used to using Git in the terminal and Markdown syntax.
