# Study Log

## *This is a journal of my Front End learning path*

I'm going to document my progress in the field of web development by putting up a journal containing all my learnings, exercises, courses, as well as everything else than helped me on my path of becoming a better Front End Developer. 

I'm going to keep this going for a few months in order to have a clear view of the progress that I'm making.

Lastly, I'm doing this in the shape of a GitHub repository in order to get used to using Git in the terminal and Markdown syntax.

## **WEEK 1 (8-12 January)**:

### **Monday**: 
* Got an intro to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and looked through the seo pages' code.
* Worked on the UL componenet which resulted in a better understanding of Flexbox (esp. flex-basis).

### **Tuesday**: 
* Continued with a Flexbox course - [Flexbox Zombies](https://geddski.teachable.com/courses/) by geddski - Understood more about flex-grow and flex-shrink.
* Got an intro on Gulp (mainly about how tasks work and Gulp in general) thanks to Max. ^^
* Created a new element in the ShowcarUI library with Max - the [link-text-box molecule](https://autoscout24.github.io/showcar-ui/#link-text-box-target) 

### **Wednesday**: 
* Continued with a Flexbox course - [Flexbox Zombies](https://geddski.teachable.com/courses/) by geddski - Understood more about flex-basis and order.
* Worked on ShowcarUI (got my own task) and renamed the new elements.

* More Git - solved some conflicts my fork had with the upstream master branch (Diana helped clarify a few things ^^).
* Used Hugo in practice for the first time (with Yifan) while working on adjusting the SEO hub pages task. It was a bit confusing, but not as hard as I previously thought => I definitely need more Hugo practice/learning.

### **Monday**: 
* Started reading from the Hugo docs, understood the [directory structure](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/) and the connection between the generated folders. 
* Worked on implementing the new ShowcarUI elements to the SEO moto homepage. The anchor list group element proved to be quite problematic, so we'll continue with it tomorrow. => *__more Hugo study is definitely needed!!__*
* Came up with a solution for one of our Hugo problem ([creating the link lists divided by first letter](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/lists-of-content-divided-by-posts-first-letter/8534))
* Forked a repo, created the upstream master remote and updated my fork -> First time I got it right without any help. Working in the terminal is getting much easier now.

* Read an article on HTTP - [HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 1](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177) => got an intro to the URL structure, verbs and status codes (pillars of HTTP communication).

### **Wednesday**: 
* Started a power up course on git called [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) -> Did 10 challenges and it really helped me understand and use Git better.
* Worked on the styles of the moto SEO hub page.
* Learned a bit more Hugo (still general stuff).

### **Thursday**: 
* Almost done with [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) --> This really made me understand git much better and use it more effectively.

### **Friday (Frontend Ninja)**: 
* Finished with [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)! Best Git course I ever did. Helped me get a better and deeper understanding on how to use git both locally and with remotes.

* Started reading from the [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).

## **WEEK 3 (22-26 January)**:

### **Monday**: 
* Looking at the Hugo docs again. Read more about shortcodes --> gonna continue though the day when I have time.
* Finished with the [Flexbox Zombies Course](https://geddski.teachable.com/courses/) --> will transform my flexbox notes into a cheatsheet when I have a bit of time.

### **Tuesday**: 
* Worked on the moro seo page - we're basically done with it, just waiting for anither team to adjust the long link list part. 
* Hugo is still confusing, but I have the feeling I understand it a bit better now.
* I really like using git through the command line. I had some issues with one of my forked repos, but I synced it with the upstream after a few tries. Now everything is up to date and I'm happy that I'm very confortable with using Git now.
* Learned about Hugo [shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/) and [content sections](https://gohugo.io/content-management/sections/) --> saw and understood a very nice example of Breadcrumbs partial.

### **Wednesday**: 
* I looked at Ruby syntax by doing a short intro course from Codecademy [Learn Ruby](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby) --> I did this because I thought it was necessary in order to solve a task, but in the end it was a different problem. 
* I continued my Hugo study -- learned about [Archtypes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/) and [Taxonomies](https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies/).
