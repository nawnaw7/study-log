          <br>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Created a new element in the ShowcarUI library with Max - the
          <a href="https://autoscout24.github.io/showcar-ui/#link-text-box-target" target="_blank">link-text-box molecule</a>

          <span class="daily-title">Thursday</span>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> 'Worked' on the SEO images optimization task with Max and looked a bit at Gulp again.

          a few things ^^).
          <br>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Used Hugo in practice for the first time (with Yifan) while working on adjusting the SEO hub pages
          task. It was a bit confusing, but not as hard as I previously thought => I definitely need more Hugo practice/learning.
          <br>

          <span class="daily-title">Friday</span>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Worked on a task given to me by Mimmo - Had to fix some bugs/do some changes to a few of ShowcarUI's
          new elements.

          <br>

          <span class="daily-title">TO DO next:</span>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Look at Hugo's
          <a href="https://gohugo.io/documentation/" target="_blank">docs</a> for detailed info.
          <br>

        <p class="daily-log">
          <span class="daily-title">Monday</span>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Started reading from the Hugo docs, understood the
          <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/"
            target="_blank">directory structure</a> and the connection between the generated folders.
          <br>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Worked on implementing the new ShowcarUI elements to the SEO moto homepage. The anchor list group
          element proved to be quite problematic, so we'll continue with it tomorrow. =>
          <strong>more Hugo study is definitely needed!!</strong>
          <br>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Came up with a solution for one of our Hugo problem (
          <a href="https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/lists-of-content-divided-by-posts-first-letter/8534"
            target="_blank">creating the link lists divided by first letter</a>
          <br>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Forked a repo, created the upstream master remote and updated my fork -> First time I got it right
          without any help. Working in the terminal is getting much easier now.

          <span class="daily-title">Tuesday</span>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Watched a course on
          <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/code-org/internet-works"
            target="_blank">How the Internet Works</a> from code.org -> Learned a bit about IPs, DNS, info packets, routers, HTTP/HTTPS.
          <br>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Read an article on HTTP -
          <a href="https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177"
            target="_blank">HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 1</a> => got an intro to the URL structure, verbs and status
          codes (pillars of HTTP communication).
          <br>

          <span class="daily-title">Wednesday</span>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Started a power up course on git called
          <a href="https://learngitbranching.js.org/" target="_blank">Learn Git Branching</a> -> Did 10 challenges and it really helped me understand and use Git better.
          <br>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Worked on the styles of the moto SEO hub page.
          <br>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Learned a bit more Hugo (still general stuff).
          <br>

          <span class="daily-title">Thursday</span>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Almost done with
          <a href="https://learngitbranching.js.org/" target="_blank">Learn Git Branching</a> --> This really made me understand git much better and use it more effectively.
          <br>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Got an intro to Jigsaw (thanks to Alex) -> 'worked' with him on a jigsaw task; we prepared for the
          release of the german moto seo pages.
          <br>

          <span class="daily-title">Friday (Frontend Ninjas)</span>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Finished with
          <a href="https://learngitbranching.js.org/" target="_blank">Learn Git Branching</a>! Best Git course I ever did. Helped me get a better and deeper understanding on how to
          use git both locally and with remotes.
          <br>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> I created a Git Commands Cheatsheet for me and my colleagues after following this course.
          <br>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Started reading from the
          <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2" target="_blank">Pro Git book</a>.
          <br>

          <span class="daily-title">TO DO next:</span>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Read the
          <a href="https://hpbn.co/" target="_blank">High Performance Browser Networking</a> book / or at least the HTTP section.
          <br>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Read more about Jigsaw and nginx.
          <br>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Look at Gulp

          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Finish reading the

          <br>

          <span class="daily-title">Monday</span>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Looking at the Hugo docs again. Read more about shortcodes --> gonna continue though the day when
          I have time.
          <br>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Finished with the
          <a href="https://geddski.teachable.com/courses/" target="_blank">Flexbox Zombies Course</a> --> will transform my flexbox notes into a cheatsheet when I have a bit of time.
          <br>

          <span class="daily-title">Tuesday</span>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Worked on the moto seo page - we're basically done with it, just waiting for another team to adjust
          the long link list part.
          <br>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Hugo is still confusing, but I have the feeling I understand it a bit better now.
          <br>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> I really like using git through the command line. I had some issues with one of my forked repos,
          but I synced it with the upstream after a few tries. Now everything is up to date and I'm happy that I'm very confortable
          with using Git now.
          <br>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Learned about Hugo
          <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/" target="_blank">shortcodes</a> and
          <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/sections/" target="_blank">content sections</a> --> saw and understood a very nice example of Breadcrumbs partial.
          <br>

          <span class="daily-title">Wednesday</span>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> I looked at Ruby syntax by doing a short intro course from Codecademy
          <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby"
            target="_blank">Learn Ruby</a> --> I did this because I thought it was necessary in order to solve a task, but in the end it was
          a different problem.
          <br>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> I continued my Hugo study -- learned about
          <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/"
            target="_blank">Archtypes</a> and
          <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies/" target="_blank">Taxonomies</a>.
          <br>

          <span class="daily-title">Thursday</span>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Pushed the branch Yifan and I worked on into the main seo-moto-pages repo!
          <br>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> I continued with studying Hugo.
          <br>

          <span class="daily-title">Friday (Frontend Ninjas)</span>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Spent the day learning about CSS Grid. Finished a short interactive course -
          <a href="http://cssgridgarden.com/"
            target="_blank">Grid Garden</a> - and read an article -
          <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/" target="_blank">A Complete Guide to Grid</a>.
          <br>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Learned a few things about PostCSS.
          <br>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Max and I worked on a css grid
          <a href="https://codepen.io/maximilian_lindsey/pen/VyoPvy?editors=1100"
            target="_blank">challenge</a> we came up with by ourselves.
          <br>

          <span class="daily-title">TO DO next:</span>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Read the

          <span class="daily-title">Monday</span>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Paired with Alex for the refactoring of the S3 bucket for the seo-moto-pages. I understood more
          or less the basics of how you configure buckets and how the cloud works.
          <br>

          <span class="daily-title">Tuesday</span>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Paired with Alex again for the S3 seo-moto-pages bucket refactoring task. After implementing a wrong
          solution, we converted everything to the right one (creating only one bucket with language based folders inside).
          <br>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span>We also merged the PR with the new styles for the moto hub page, but the images' URL change broke
          our page. We're in the process of fixing this.
          <br>

          <span class="daily-title">Wednesday</span>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Had my first Post Mortem meeting. After things went wrong with the latest release of our Seo moto pages, we held a meeting in which we discussed the problem, their causes and the counter-measures to be taken. It was very interesting and helpful at the same time.
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Max and I discussed our presentation for next week and made a plan.
          <br>

          <span class="daily-title">Thursday</span>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Got a task from Lili to modify some styles on the moto hub page (make certain subtitles smaller and add a border-bottom to several containers).
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Today was full of meetings so I didn't have much time to do anything.
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Got my Gocd access and had a short intro to it.
          <br>

          <span class="daily-title">Friday (Frontend Ninjas)</span>
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> Checked the changes I made together with Lili and pushed the changes into the repo...
          <span class="arrows">&roarr;</span> I learned about SEO techniques. See the <a href="https://github.com/AutoScout24/frontend-ninjas-log">Frontend Ninjas Log</a>
