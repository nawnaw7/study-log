                <span class="daily-title">Monday</span> 
                * Got an intro to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and looked through the seo pages' code. <br>
                * Worked on the UL componenet which resulted in a better understanding of Flexbox (esp. flex-basis). <br>

                <span class="daily-title">Tuesday</span>
                * Continued with a Flexbox course - [Flexbox Zombies](https://geddski.teachable.com/courses/) by geddski - Understood more about flex-grow and flex-shrink. <br>
                * Got an intro on Gulp (mainly about how tasks work and Gulp in general) thanks to Max. ^^ <br>
                * Created a new element in the ShowcarUI library with Max - the [link-text-box molecule](https://autoscout24.github.io/showcar-ui/#link-text-box-target) <br>

                <span class="daily-title">Wednesday</span>
                * Continued with a Flexbox course - [Flexbox Zombies](https://geddski.teachable.com/courses/) by geddski - Understood more about flex-basis and order. <br>
                * Worked on ShowcarUI (got my own task) and renamed the new elements. <br>
                * Learned more about Git and terminal (PRs, branches, remotes...). <br>

                <span class="daily-title">Thursday</span>
                * 'Worked' on the SEO images optimization task with Max and looked a bit at Gulp again. <br>
                 * Continued with a Flexbox course - [Flexbox Zombies](https://geddski.teachable.com/courses/) by geddski - Understood more about flex-wrap. <br>
                * More Git - solved some conflicts my fork had with the upstream master branch (Diana helped clarify a few things ^^). <br>
                * Used Hugo in practice for the first time (with Yifan) while working on adjusting the SEO hub pages task. It was a bit confusing, but not as hard as I previously thought => I definitely need more Hugo practice/learning. <br>

                <span class="daily-title">Friday</span>
                * Worked on a task given to me by Mimmo - Had to fix some bugs/do some changes to a few of ShowcarUI's new elements. <br>
                * Got a better understanding of Git. <br>
                * Watched some vidoes on how the Internet works. <br>
